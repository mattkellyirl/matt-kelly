                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Outside of development, I'm also a qualified light vehicle mechanic, having completed my 4 year apprenticeship at a performance vehicle dealership in the Adelaide Hills. Motorsport is my passion, and I've experienced working as a motorsport mechanic at a professional level. I'm fortunate enough to compete as a racing driver myself - racing has always been a part of my life, and as a result I'm very competitive in everything that I do.</p>

                </section>
            </section>

            <p>I am currently studying full stack development at the University of Adelaide - fluent in HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript with skills in other technologies such as Git, jQuery, MySQL and VS Code.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have extensive graphic design and film experience, and am proficient in After Effects, Premiere Pro, Illustrator, InDesign and Photoshop.</p>
            <br>
            <p>From reading this, you have probably realised that I love making things, building things and understanding why and how they work. If you did, I'd love to work with you!</p>
